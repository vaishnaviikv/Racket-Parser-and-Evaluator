# Racket-Parser-and-Evaluator

WE will implement a parser and evaluator for a
simple language.  It extends the first language we implemented an
interpreter for in class by adding the following features:

- Adding boolean values and lists and basic operations on them.
- If statements.
- Binding multiple variables at a time with let and let*
- Limited forms of recursion on numbers and values

The starter code is split across multiple files:

- ps2-ast.rkt --- defines the types for values and expressions in the
  language and documents the behavior of the expressions.

- ps2.rkt --- parse and eval implementations go here 

- ps2-test.rkt --- contains testing code. The list test-examples is a
  list of s-expressions for example programs. The list test-asts is a
  list of ASTs generated by our reference solution corresponding to
  these s-expressions, (e.g. the ith element of this list is the AST
  for the ith program in test-examples). The list test-results is a
  list of values corresponding to what executing these programs should
  result in.  (e.g. the ith element of test-results is what you should
  get after parsing and evaluating the ith program in test-examples).
